        <div class="heading bold">Description</div>
        <p class="text">Pasta salad is, as the name implies, a dish that contains one or more types of pasta as well as other vegetables as preferred.
            It can be served either chilled or at room temperature but is never served hot. Can also be tossed in some sort of dressing
            if preferred.
        </p>
        <p class="text">This is usually served as an appetizer or first course of a meal. It is never typically the main course because it is very light.
            It is also typically served at cookouts, wedding receptions, family reunions, and other similar gatherings. It is relatively easy
            to make and only requires a few ingredients. In fact, the only required ingredient is the pasta although it is usually served with
            at least one other ingredient. It is highly customizable because anything can be added.
