        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Lemonade is a refreshing citrus beverage that many people enjoy. It is often served in the summer time when it is hot outside to help people cool off.
            Children often have lemonade stands in the summer months to earn a little bit of money while they are out of school.
        </p>

        <p>Some people prefer their lemonade to be more sour while other like it to be sweeter. Any person can adjust it to the way they like by adding or reducing
            the amount of sugar used in the recipe. There are also many variations of this, such as pink lemonade, but they all rely on the classic recipe.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>5 lemons</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/4 quarts water</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel the rinds from the 5 lemons and cut them into 1/2 inch slices. Set the lemons aside.</li>
            <li>Place the rinds in a bowl and sprinkle the sugar over them. Let this stand for about one hour, so that the sugar begins to soak up the oils from the lemons.</li>
            <li>Bring water to a boil in a covered saucepan and then pour the hot water over the sugared lemon rinds. Allow this mixture to cool for 20 minutes and then
                remove the rinds.
            </li>
            <li>Squeeze the lemons into another bowl. Pour the juice through a strainer into the sugar mixture. Stir well, pour into a pitcher and pop it in the fridge!
                Serve with ice cubes.
